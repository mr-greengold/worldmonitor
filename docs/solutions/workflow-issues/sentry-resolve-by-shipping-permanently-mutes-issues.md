# Resolve-by-shipping silently mutes browser Sentry issues forever

## Problem

WorldMonitor's documented triage doctrine was resolve by shipping. Put a `Fixes` marker naming a Sentry short ID in the commit message or the PR body and let the Sentry GitHub integration close the issue. The integration does not issue a plain resolve. It resolves the issue `inRelease: <commit-sha>`.

Sentry reopens a release-pinned issue only when an event arrives in a release **newer** than the pin. WorldMonitor's two instrumented surfaces do not agree on what a release is.

The browser bundle keeps a stable semver release and carries the SHA beside it. `src/bootstrap/sentry-build-metadata.ts:22` builds the release as `worldmonitor@${appVersion}`, `package.json:4` pins that version at `2.10.0`, and the commit SHA goes to `dist` at `sentry-build-metadata.ts:28` plus a `build_sha` tag at `sentry-build-metadata.ts:31`. Every browser event therefore lands in `worldmonitor@2.10.0`.

The server and edge surface does the opposite. `api/_sentry-common.js:104` sets `release: process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`, so those events land in SHA-named releases and do order correctly against a SHA-named pin.

The integration invents a third thing. It creates a release object named after the commit SHA, and browser events never belong to it. A browser event can never outrank the pin, so the issue can never reopen. It reads resolved forever while the bug keeps firing.

`sentry-build-metadata.ts` is not the bug. Release-plus-`dist` is a coherent, documented, deliberate choice, and the file comment at `sentry-build-metadata.ts:13` states the reason. The defect is that auto-resolve-on-commit assumes a release model the browser bundle does not use.

There is a sharper sub-trap. A commit message that merely **quotes** the marker while explaining the defect still fires it. Sentry matches keyword-plus-short-ID anywhere in a commit message or a PR body. Backticks, code fences, and surrounding prose do not escape it. File content is not scanned, so the same characters are safe inside a source file or a markdown doc. Only commit messages and PR bodies are parsed.

## Symptoms

- The resolved board carried 253 issues across 3 pages on 2026-09-07. Exactly 3 had a non-empty `statusDetails`, all of kind `inRelease`. Those were WORLDMONITOR-122, WORLDMONITOR-11X, and WORLDMONITOR-11Y. The other 250 were exactly `{}`.
- Two of the three had been re-pinned to SHAs newer than the ones the origin issue recorded. The defect recurs on every qualifying merge rather than sitting static.
- A pinned issue shows as resolved in every Sentry view and in every triage sweep while new events keep arriving underneath it. Nothing surfaces the mute.
- During this very fix, a commit body containing the pattern inside backticks, in a sentence describing the defect, pinned a live issue `inCommit` to that commit. The issue was an `Uncaught ConvexError: {"kind":"DODO_PORTAL_ERROR"}` with 4 events across 3 users, last seen 2026-08-21. It had previously been a clean plain resolve.

## What Didn't Work

**Writing `status=resolved` over an already-resolved issue.** The API returns HTTP 200 and silently no-ops. The pin stays. Trusting that response would have reported three repairs that never happened.

**Widening the query window to see more of the board.** `statsPeriod` accepts only `''`, `24h`, and `14d`. Both `30d` and `90d` return HTTP 400 `Invalid stats_period`. All three accepted values return the same 253 issues, so the parameter gates the per-issue stats series, not the population.

**Following `Link: rel="next"` until it disappears.** The `rel="next"` entry is present on the last page too, carrying `results="false"`. A pager that reads only `rel` loops forever.

**Using the token already in `.env.local`.** That is a `sntrys_` release-scoped upload token for source maps. It returns 403 on the issues endpoint regardless of which project it was minted for. Reading issues needs a `sntryu_` user token with `event:read` and `project:read`.

**Testing `statusDetails` for emptiness.** A pinned row also carries an `actor` object, so emptiness is a proxy for the pin, not the pin itself. The moment Sentry attaches `actor` to plain resolves as well, an emptiness test flags all 250 clean rows. Archived issues break it from the other direction. `archived_until_condition_met` legitimately populates `{ignoreCount, ignoreWindow}`, while `archived_forever` and `archived_until_escalating` both report `statusDetails: {}`. Archive mode lives in `substatus`, not in `statusDetails`.

**The old acceptance line in the triage skill.** It forbade only `inNextRelease`. Three `inRelease` pins sat muted while the skill's own acceptance check reported a pass.

## Solution

**Repair each pinned issue through a status transition.** A resolved-to-resolved write no-ops, so the status has to leave `resolved` and come back. Read every step back rather than trusting the write response.

```bash
# 1. Drop the pin by leaving the resolved state.
curl -sS -X PUT "https://us.sentry.io/api/0/issues/$ISSUE_ID/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status":"unresolved"}' >/dev/null

# 2. Confirm the transition landed.
curl -sS "https://us.sentry.io/api/0/issues/$ISSUE_ID/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" | jq '.status'

# 3. Resolve plainly, with no statusDetails.
curl -sS -X PUT "https://us.sentry.io/api/0/issues/$ISSUE_ID/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status":"resolved"}' >/dev/null

# 4. Confirm the pin is gone. Expect {}.
curl -sS "https://us.sentry.io/api/0/issues/$ISSUE_ID/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" | jq '.statusDetails'
```

This sequence was run against WORLDMONITOR-122, WORLDMONITOR-11X, and WORLDMONITOR-11Y. All three came back with `statusDetails` empty.

**A read-only audit that finds the next one.** `scripts/audit-sentry-resolve-pins.mjs` pages the resolved board and classifies each row on which pin key `statusDetails` carries. `PIN_KINDS` at `scripts/audit-sentry-resolve-pins.mjs:77` names `inRelease`, `inNextRelease`, and `inCommit`. `classifyResolution` at line 107 returns the first key present and `plain` otherwise. `auditResolvedIssues` at line 119 rejects a non-array payload outright, skips rows whose `status` is not `resolved` at line 131, and reports the rest. Nothing in the script mutates Sentry. `formatRepairRecipe` at line 171 prints the transition sequence next to the findings.

The script hard-codes the three API traps. `issuesUrl` at line 205 sends `statsPeriod=''`. `parseLinkHeader` at line 95 requires both `rel="next"` and `results="true"` before it returns a cursor. `fetchResolvedIssues` at line 231 turns a 403 into an error message that names the `sntrys_`-versus-`sntryu_` token distinction instead of a bare status code.

Run it locally.

```bash
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=sntryu_... npm run audit:sentry-resolve-pins
```

**Tests.** `tests/sentry-resolve-pins.test.mjs` holds 17 tests. Verified with `node --test tests/sentry-resolve-pins.test.mjs`, 17 pass, 0 fail.

**A daily job.** `.github/workflows/sentry-resolve-pin-audit.yml` runs on cron `17 6 * * *` plus `workflow_dispatch`. The step at line 30 fails loudly when `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is absent instead of skipping. That secret did not exist in the repo as of 2026-09-07, so the workflow fails until it is added.

**Doctrine correction.** `.agents/skills/sentry-triage/SKILL.md:40` now states plain resolve only and names all three pin kinds. Line 119 records that the integration currently resolves `inRelease: <commit-sha>` and that no browser event can outrank it.

**Attribution.** `us.sentry.io` is now an `excluded` entry in `PROVIDER_OVERRIDES` at `scripts/source-attribution.mjs:764`, matching the `api.axiom.co` precedent above it, so the error-tracking vendor does not enter the published provider count.

This work is PR #7839, which is unmerged as of 2026-09-07.

## Why This Works

The transition works because the pin lives in `statusDetails` and Sentry only recomputes `statusDetails` on a real status change. Leaving `resolved` clears it. Returning to `resolved` with no `statusDetails` in the body produces a plain resolve.

Classifying on the pin key rather than on emptiness ties the audit to the thing that actually mutes an issue. A pinned row is pinned because `statusDetails.inRelease` exists, not because the object is non-empty. The audit survives Sentry attaching new metadata to clean resolves, and it does not misread an intentional `archived_until_condition_met` window as a pin.

Skipping rows whose `status` is not `resolved` keeps that guarantee even when the `is:resolved` query returns something else. The audit trusts the row, not the query string.

Failing on an empty board closes the last hole. A wrong org, a wrong project, or a token that cannot see the project all return an empty list, which is indistinguishable from a clean board. `assertLiveBoardIsNotEmpty` at `scripts/audit-sentry-resolve-pins.mjs:183` throws on that shape. An audit whose broken state looks like its passing state protects nothing.

Only the short ID, permalink, pin kind, and sanitized pin value reach the report. A pinned `statusDetails` embeds an `actor` object carrying the resolver's email, gravatar URL, `dateJoined`, and `lastLogin`. Any tool that dumps `statusDetails` raw leaks that into CI logs.

## Prevention

**Plain resolve only.** Never resolve into `inRelease`, `inNextRelease`, or `inCommit`. Read `statusDetails` back after every resolve and confirm it is `{}`. Do not trust the write response, because a resolved-to-resolved write returns 200 without changing anything.

**Scan commit messages before pushing.** A keyword adjacent to a `WORLDMONITOR-` token fires the integration anywhere in a commit message or a PR body, including inside backticks and code fences.

```bash
git log <base>..HEAD --format=%B \
  | grep -Eio '(fix|fixes|fixed|close|closes|closed|resolve|resolves|resolved)[[:space:]]+WORLDMONITOR-[A-Z0-9]+'
```

Any hit means rewrite the message before the branch is visible. Put the short ID and the keyword in separate sentences, or drop the keyword. After rewriting, confirm the tree is byte-identical with `git diff <old-sha> HEAD` returning empty, then force-push. File content is never scanned, so the same text is safe in a source file or a doc.

**Audit the board on a schedule and on demand.**

```bash
npm run audit:sentry-resolve-pins
```

It exits non-zero and emits a `::error::` line per pinned issue. The daily workflow runs the same command.

**This is a recurring failure mode, not a one-off.** Issue #6367 recorded the same class on 2026-08-09, when 21 issues sat muted behind `inNextRelease` pins and 6 were still firing, one of them at 357k events. That incident is why the triage skill's acceptance line named `inNextRelease` specifically. Naming one pin kind is what let three `inRelease` pins pass the same check a month later. Assert on the shape (`statusDetails` is empty) rather than on a blocklist of pin kinds.

**One gap remains open.** Turning off resolve-on-commit in the Sentry GitHub integration dashboard is the only change that prevents rather than detects. It was not done as of 2026-09-07, and it is a dashboard setting, so no check in this repo can confirm its state. Until it is, the pre-commit grep catches a bad message before it lands and the daily audit catches a landed one within a day, but neither prevents the pin.
